/**
  * @class ContextMutexLocker mutex.h core/mutex.h
  *
  * This class will lock the mutex when created, and will unlock it when destroyed.
  * 
  * Examples of usage are:
  *
  * @code
  * void Class::methodWithCriticalSection()
  * {
  *     ContextMutexLocker cml(theLock);
  *     // critical section here
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * what is equivalent to:
  *
  * @code
  * void Class::methodWithCriticalSection()
  * {
  *     theLock.lock();
  *     // critical section here
  *     theLock.unlock();
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * Having critical sections as small as possible is a good idea. If the whole method
  * is not a critical section, you can do something like this:
  *
  * @code
  * void Class::methodWithCriticalSection()
  * {
  *     // non critical section here
  *     {
  *         ContextMutexLocker cml(theLock);
  *         // critical section here
  *     }
  *     // non critical section here
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * what is equivalent to:
  *
  * @code
  * void Class::methodWithCriticalSection()
  * {
  *     // non critical section here
  *     theLock.lock();
  *     // critical section here
  *     theLock.unlock();
  *     // non critical section here
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * This will help also visually to detect really fast critical sections.
