/**
  * @class Application application.h core/application.h
  *
  * The application. All ideal library based applications need an instance of this class.
  * It allows you to parse options passed to the application when it was launched, as well as other
  * miscellaneous operations. Usually, all applications based on the Ideal Library will look like
  * this on the very beginning:
  *
  * @code
  * #include <core/application.h>
  *
  * int main(int argc, char **argv)
  * {
  *     Application app(argc, argv);
  *     // code
  *     return 0;
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * This is an example of an extremely simple application. This application will not even have
  * event handling, because a main event loop hasn't been launched. The following example will be
  * able to handle events:
  *
  * @code
  * #include <core/application.h>
  *
  * int main(int argc, char **argv)
  * {
  *     Application app(argc, argv);
  *     // code
  *     return app.exec(); // launch the main event loop, and process events until quit() is called in app
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * So, for example, if you have a top-level object in your application, it would look like this:
  *
  * @code
  * #include <core/object.h>
  * #include <core/application.h>
  *
  * int main(int argc, char **argv)
  * {
  *     Application app(argc, argv);
  *     Object *object = new Object(&app);
  *     // code
  *     return app.exec();
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
