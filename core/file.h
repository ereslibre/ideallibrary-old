/**
  * @class File file.h core/file.h
  *
  * This class represents a file in a local or remote filesystem. If the file is located on the
  * local file system, all the information will be retrieved through system calls. On the other hand
  * if the file is living on a remote filesystem, we will try to create a correct protocol handler,
  * which will get the file information.
  *
  * @note The API for retrieving information about files is asynchronous, but it is fairly easy to
  *       retrieve the contents of several files reusing code, using Object::connectMulti or
  *       Object::connectStaticMulti. For example, say we want to find out if a list of files
  *       exist. We could do:
  *
  * @code
  * List<File*>::iterator it;
  * for (it = fileList.begin(); it != fileList.end(); ++it) {
  *     File *const file = *it;
  *     connectMulti(file->existsResult, this, &MyObject::existsResultSlot);
  *     Thread *const size = file->size();
  *     size->exec();
  * }
  *
  * void MyObject::existsResultSlot(Object *sender, bool exists)
  * {
  *     File *const sdr = static_cast<File*>(sender);
  *     IDEAL_SDEBUG("*** File " << sdr->uri().uri() << " exists? " << (exists ? "yes" : "no"));
  *     // or do something interesting using 'sender' (or 'sdr') and 'exists'
  * }
  * @endcode
