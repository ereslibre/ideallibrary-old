      * When you are given the result, you can ask the Module class for the extensions it

      * @return The module located at @p path if the loading of the module was successful. 0
      *         otherwise.
      *
      * @note You should never delete the returned content. The Ideal Library will take care of it.
      *       The way it works is: when you call to loadExtension() a reference counter goes up 1 on
      *       the module that contains that extension. When that extension is deleted the reference
      *       counter goes down 1. If this counter hits 0, the module is automatically deleted and
      *       removed from memory.
      *
      * @note For the automatic module freeing it is necessary that Application::exec() has been
      *       called (there is an event loop running).
      *
      * @warning If you call to loadModule() but never call to loadExtension() using that module,
      *          it will never be autodeleted. You are responsible of deleting it as if it were a
      *          regular pointer. You can use the method Module::isUnused() to find out if you can
      *          directly delete it.
