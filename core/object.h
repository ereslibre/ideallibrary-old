/*!
 * @page workingWithSignals Working with signals
 *
 * Signals are a powerful way of telling other components that something has just happened. They will
 * let you write dynamic code that will react to things that are happening at other place of your
 * code.
 *
 * @section simpleSignal Defining a very simple signal with no arguments
 *
 * @code
 * #include <core/object.h>
 *
 * class MyObject
 *     : public IdealCore::Object
 * {
 * public:
 *     MyObject(Object *parent);
 *
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(myFirstSignal);
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now, some details that you should take into account:
 *
 *     - Signals can only be defined inside Object subclasses. Now any instance of class MyObject
 *       will have a signal called myFirstSignal.
 *
 *     - Signals can only be connected to methods in Object subclasses. Always that we speak about
 *       connecting a signal to an objects' method. We will see later that we can connect a signal
 *       to a static method or function.
 *
 * Let's continue with the implementation. Every signal declaration needs its initialization:
 *
 * @code
 * MyObject::MyObject(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(myFirstSignal)
 * {
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note the way we are initializing it. We have to always initialize signals on the object
 * constructors. On all object constructors. If you forget to initialize a signal, like this:
 *
 * @code
 * MyObject::MyObject(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent) // missing IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT on this constructor
 * {
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * When we try to compile this, we will get an error message similar to this one:
 *
 * @code
 * example.cpp: In constructor 'MyObject(IdealCore::Object*)':
 * example.cpp:85: error: call to 'IdealCore::Signal<>::Signal' declared with attribute error: missing call to IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT on your class constructor
 * @endcode
 *
 * So the compiler will warn you: "missing call to IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT on your class constructor".
 *
 * @section complexSignal Defining a complex signal with several arguments
 *
 * @code
 * #include <core/object.h>
 * #include <core/ideal_list.h>
 *
 * class MyObject
 *     : public IdealCore::Object
 * {
 * public:
 *     MyObject(Object *parent);
 *
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(myComplexSignal, bool, int, Object*, List<Object*>);
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * As you may imagine, the initialization is not very different:
 *
 * @code
 * MyObject::MyObject(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(myComplexSignal, bool, int, Object*, List<Object*>)
 * {
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section severalSignals Defining several signals in an object
 *
 * We have learnt until now that a signal is composed by its name, and the parameters it can take
 * to carry information with it. Obviously, we can make our object contain several signals, let's
 * look at it:
 *
 * @code
 * #include <core/object.h>
 * #include <core/ideal_list.h>
 *
 * class MyObject
 *     : public IdealCore::Object
 * {
 * public:
 *     MyObject(Object *parent);
 *
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(myFirstSignal);
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(myComplexSignal, bool, int, Object*, List<Object*>);
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Being the initialization:
 *
 * @code
 * MyObject::MyObject(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(myFirstSignal)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(myComplexSignal, bool, int, Object*, List<Object*>)
 * {
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Right now we have a complete way of filling our objects with signals. That is pretty useless if
 * we cannot do anything with them. Let's connect code. Now, suppose we are working with the last
 * MyObject example that we have written. Let's write MyOtherObject.
 *
 * @code
 * #include <core/object.h>
 *
 * class MyOtherObject
 *     : public IdealCore::Object
 * {
 * public:
 *     MyOtherObject(Object *parent);
 *
 *     void doSomethingEasy();
 *     void doSomethingComplex(bool a, int b, Object *c, const List<Object*> &d);
 *
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(myForwardedSignal);
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * As you can see, we have defined two regular methods, as well as another signal. We are going to
 * learn the basics here: how to connect a signal to a method, and how to forward a signal. Let's
 * have a look at the implementation:
 *
 * @code
 * #include <core/application.h>
 *
 * MyOtherObject::MyOtherObject(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(myForwardedSignal)
 * {
 * }
 *
 * void MyOtherObject::doSomethingEasy()
 * {
 *     IDEAL_SDEBUG("We have done something easy");
 * }
 *
 * void MyOtherObject::doSomethingComplex(bool, int, Object*, const List<Object*>&)
 * {
 *     IDEAL_SDEBUG("We have done something complex");
 * }
 *
 * int main(int argc, char **argv)
 * {
 *     IdealCore::Application app(argc, argv);
 *
 *     MyObject *myObject = new MyObject(&app);
 *     MyOtherObject *myOtherObject = new MyOtherObject(&app);
 *
 *     IdealCore::Object::connect(myObject->myFirstSignal, myOtherObject, &MyOtherObject::doSomethingEasy);
 *     IdealCore::Object::connect(myObject->myComplexSignal, myOtherObject, &MyOtherObject::doSomethingComplex);
 *     IdealCore::Object::connect(myObject->myFirstSignal, myOtherObject->myForwardedSignal);
 *
 *     return 0;     
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * As you can see, in the main application we have connected three times:
 *
 *     - Regular connections:
 *         - myFirstSignal at myObject with doSomethingEasy at myOtherObject.
 *         - myComplexSignal at myObject with doSomethingComplex at myOtherObject.
 *
 *     - Signal forward:
 *         - myFirstSignal at myObject with myForwardedSignal at myOtherObject.
 *
 * But yet nothing happens. We have to emit signals for things to happen after having connected
 * them to other parts of the code. Let's revisit MyObject class for adding a method that will do
 * something and later will emit myFirstSignal:
 *
 * @code
 * #include <core/object.h>
 * #include <core/ideal_list.h>
 *
 * class MyObject
 *     : public IdealCore::Object
 * {
 * public:
 *     MyObject(Object *parent);
 *
 *     void modifyStateAndNotify();
 *
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(myFirstSignal);
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(myComplexSignal, bool, int, Object*, List<Object*>);
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Being the initialization:
 *
 * @code
 * MyObject::MyObject(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(myFirstSignal)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(myComplexSignal, bool, int, Object*, List<Object*>)
 * {
 * }
 *
 * void MyObject::modifyStateAndNotify()
 * {
 *     IDEAL_SDEBUG("We have modified an attribute and are going to emit myFirstSignal");
 *     emit(myFirstSignal);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now, from the main application code we could do:
 *
 * @code
 * int main(int argc, char **argv)
 * {
 *     IdealCore::Application app(argc, argv);
 *
 *     MyObject *myObject = new MyObject(&app);
 *     MyOtherObject *myOtherObject = new MyOtherObject(&app);
 *
 *     IdealCore::Object::connect(myObject->myFirstSignal, myOtherObject, &MyOtherObject::doSomethingEasy);
 *     IdealCore::Object::connect(myObject->myComplexSignal, myOtherObject, &MyOtherObject::doSomethingComplex);
 *     IdealCore::Object::connect(myObject->myFirstSignal, myOtherObject->myForwardedSignal);
 *
 *     myObject->modifyStateAndNotify();
 *
 *     return 0;     
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * This will cause the next output on terminal:
 *
 * @code
 * We have done something easy
 * @endcode
 *
 * We have emitted myFirstSignal which has no arguments, so it contains no information. Emitting
 * a signal that contains parameters is not harder. Let's suppose we wanted to emit myComplexSignal:
 *
 * @code
 * void MyObject::modifyStateAndNotify()
 * {
 *     IDEAL_SDEBUG("We have modified an attribute and are going to emit myFirstSignal");
 *     emit(myComplexSignal, false, 6, parent(), List<Object*>());
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section multislots Multislots
 *
 * Multislots are handy when you have to decide something depending on who sent the signal that
 * called to that method. Let's see an example of a MediaPlayer with MediaButtons:
 *
 * @code
 * #include <core/object.h>
 * #include <core/application.h>
 *
 * class MediaButton
 *     : public IdealCore::Object
 * {
 * public:
 *     MediaButton(Object *parent);
 *
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(clicked);
 * };
 *
 * MediaButton::MediaButton(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(clicked)
 * {
 * }
 *
 * class MediaPlayer
 *     : public IdealCore::Object
 * {
 * public:
 *     MediaPlayer(Object *parent);
 *
 *     void simulatePlayPauseClick();
 *     void simulateStopClick();
 *     void simulateQuitClick();
 *
 *     void executeAction(Object *sender);
 *
 * private:
 *     MediaButton *m_playPause;
 *     MediaButton *m_stop;
 *     MediaButton *m_quit;
 * };
 *
 * MediaPlayer::MediaPlayer(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent)
 *     , m_playPause(new MediaButton(this))
 *     , m_stop(new MediaButton(this))
 *     , m_quit(new MediaButton(this))
 * {
 *     connectMulti(m_playPause->clicked, this, &MediaPlayer::executeAction);
 *     connectMulti(m_stop->clicked, this, &MediaPlayer::executeAction);
 *     connectMulti(m_quit->clicked, this, &MediaPlayer::executeAction);
 * }
 *
 * void MediaPlayer::simulatePlayPauseClick()
 * {
 *     m_playPause->emit(m_playPause->clicked);
 * }
 *
 * void MediaPlayer::simulateStopClick()
 * {
 *     m_stop->emit(m_stop->clicked);
 * }
 *
 * void MediaPlayer::simulateQuitClick()
 * {
 *     m_quit->emit(m_quit->clicked);
 * }
 *
 * void MediaPlayer::executeAction(Object *sender)
 * {
 *     switch (sender) {
 *         case m_playPause:
 *             IDEAL_SDEBUG("Play or pause was clicked");
 *             break;
 *         case m_stop:
 *             IDEAL_SDEBUG("Stop was clicked");
 *             break;
 *         default:
 *             IDEAL_SDEBUG("Quit was clicked");
 *             application()->quit();
 *             break;
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * int main(int argc, char **argv)
 * {
 *     IdealCore::Application app(argc, argv);
 *
 *     MediaPlayer *mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer(&app);
 *     mediaPlayer->simulatePlayPauseClick();
 *     mediaPlayer->simulateStopClick();
 *     mediaPlayer->simulateQuitClick();
 *
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * To sum up this example, you can see that clicked signal has no parameters. But we connected it
 * to a method that was taking one parameter (an Object*), that is exactly who emitted the signal
 * that called that method.
 *
 * Basically, the important thing to learn from this example, is that if you connect a signal to
 * a multislot, it has to contain as a first parameter an Object*, and then, the parameters the
 * signal has. For example, if we want to connect a signal defined by:
 *
 * @code
 * IDEAL_SIGNAL(myComplexSignal, bool, int, Object*, List<Object*>);
 * @endcode
 *
 * to a multislot, it would have to look like this:
 *
 * @code
 * void Whatever::aMultiSlotExample(Object *sender, bool a, int b, Object *c, const List<Object*> &d)
 * {
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The connection would be exactly the same:
 *
 * @code
 * IdealCore::Object::connectMulti(object->myComplexSignal, whatever, &Whatever::aMultiSlotExample);
 * @endcode
