 * @mainpage Ideal Library
 *
 * The Ideal Library is a free, intuitive, easy-to-use and consistent library meant to easily
 * develop applications.
 *
 * The Ideal Library will allow you to declare signals, which can be later connected to any
 * other method. It is important to note that you can only declare signals in classes that
 * inherit IdealCore::Object. The same goes for methods that are called by signals. A method
 * that can be called by a signal has no special treatment. It is a regular method.
 *
 * Declaring a signal on Ideal Library is very easy:
 *
 * @code
 * class MyClass
 *     : public IdealCore::Object
 * {
 * public:
 *     MyClass(IdealCore::Object *parent);
 *     ~MyClass();
 *
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(finished); // a signal called 'finished'
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The second step is to initialize it on the definition of the constructor(s):
 *
 * @code
 * MyClass::MyClass(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(finished)
 * {
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Declaring a signal with one parameter, for example, is not harder:
 *
 * @code
 * class MyClass
 *     : public IdealCore::Object
 * {
 * public:
 *     MyClass(IdealCore::Object *parent);
 *     ~MyClass();
 *
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(finished, int);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @code
 * MyClass::MyClass(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(finished, int)
 * {
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * You can have an indetermined number of parameters, and of course they can be complex:
 *
 * @code
 * class MyClass
 *     : public IdealCore::Object
 * {
 * public:
 *     MyClass(IdealCore::Object *parent);
 *     ~MyClass();
 *
 *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(finished, int, IdealCore::Object*, MyClass*, IdealCore::String);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @code
 * MyClass::MyClass(Object *parent)
 *     : Object(parent)
 *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(finished, int, Object*, MyClass*, String)
 * {
 * }
 * @endcode

namespace IdealCore {

class Application;

/**
  * The base class for Ideal library usage. Inheriting this class will allow you to use signals
  * and connect them to methods in any class that inherits IdealCore::Object.
  *
  * Examples of declaring signals are:
  *
  * @code
  * class MyClass
  *     : public IdealCore::Object
  * {
  * public:
  *     MyClass(IdealCore::Object *parent);
  *     ~MyClass();
  *
  *     void randomMethod(); // does something
  *
  *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(finished); // notifies that something has finished
  * ];
  * @endcode
  *
  * Then in the CPP when defining the methods... don't forget the constructor as follows:
  *
  * @code
  * MyClass::MyClass(Object *parent)
  *     : Object(parent)
  *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(finished)
  * {
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * Following this example, suppose randomMethod() method emits finished, it would do the following:
  *
  * @code
  * void MyClass::randomMethod()
  * {
  *     // some operations here
  *     emit(finished);
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * An example of a signal taking two arguments:
  *
  * @code
  * class MyClass
  *     : public IdealCore::Object
  * {
  * public:
  *     MyClass(IdealCore::Object *parent);
  *     ~MyClass();
  *
  *     void randomMethod();
  *
  *     IDEAL_SIGNAL(finished, int, IdealCore::Object*);
  *
  * private:
  *     IdealCore::Object *otherObject;
  * ];
  * @endcode
  *
  * Then in the CPP when defining the methods don't forget the constructor as follows:
  *
  * @code
  * MyClass::MyClass(Object *parent)
  *     : Object(parent)
  *     , IDEAL_SIGNAL_INIT(finished, int, Object*)
  * {
  *     // init here otherObject for example
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * Following this example, suppose randomMethod() method emits finished, it would do the following:
  *
  * @code
  * void MyClass::randomMethod()
  * {
  *     int value = 0;
  *     // some operations here and value updated
  *
  *     emit(finished, value, otherObject);
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
