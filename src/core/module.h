  * A shared library can only contain one module. This module can contain several extensions that
  * are shown to the world by the method extensionInfoList. An example of a module with only one
  * extension would be:
  *
  * @code
  * class MyOwnModule
  *     : public Module
  * {
  * public:
  *     List<Module::ExtensionInfo> extensionInfoList()
  *     {
  *         List<Module::ExtensionInfo> res;
  *
  *         Module::ExtensionInfo extInfo;
  *         extInfo.entryPoint = "extension1"; // (*)
  *         extInfo.extensionType = VideoPluginType;
  *         extInfo.componentOwner = "myApplicationName";
  *         extInfo.name = "Video Plugin for Foo";
  *         extInfo.description = "A Video Plugin for Foo";
  *         extInfo.author = "The author of the plugin";
  *         extInfo.version = "3.141592";
  *
  *         res.push_back(extInfo);
  *
  *         return res;
  *     }
  * };
  *
  * GLOBAL_MODULE_ENTRY_POINT(MyOwnModule)
  * @endcode
  *
  * This example shows the shared library from the module point of view. It is not complete. For it
  * being complete, it is missing:
  *
  * @code
  * class VideoPluginFoo
  *     : public VideoPlugin // VideoPlugin usually will be an interface inheriting IdealCore::Extension
  * {
  *     // Code comes here
  * };
  *
  * // Also here...
  *
  * EXTENSION_ENTRY_POINT(extension1, VideoPluginFoo) // note that the first parameter is the entry
  *                                                   // point, set at (*)
  * @endcode
