The Ideal Library is using the Waf building system. This makes specially easy for the library to
be installed and uninstalled.

INSTALLATION
============

* We start by configuring the project. We are going to install it into "/usr":

    # ./waf configure --prefix=/usr

    * If we wanted to install it into "/usr" but in release mode (with no debug information), we
      would have done:

        # ./waf configure --release --prefix=/usr

* Now that we have configured it, and everything went fine, we can continue:

    # ./waf build

    * If we don't want building information, but a nice progress bar instead, we can do:

        # ./waf build -p

* And we can install it now:

    # [sudo] ./waf install

Note: Install should run unit tests at the end. They _should_ pass without errors. If unit tests are
failing for you, please, fill a bug report.

You are done. The library is installed :)

UNINSTALLATION
==============

# ./waf uninstall

You are done. The library is uninstalled :)
