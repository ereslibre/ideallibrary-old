Philosophy
==========

- KISS

- POSIX

- We do use C++ on steroids, that is, we compile using GCC with the option -std=c++0x.

- Obviously, this library is free software (LGPLv3).


Strong points
=============

- No "slot" concept, all methods are slots, since Ideal works through callbacks.

- Signal/Slot type safe at compile time.

- Ambit-safe signals and slots.

- No string based naming. Everything is solved at compile time.

- No external tool needed for compiling other than the compiler itself.

- You know in which order slots will become called when a signal is emitted.

- Slightly faster than Qt's signal/slot connection.

- If the signature of a signal/slot changes, there is no need of check the code itself for
  fixing connections.

- Very easy to extend through Modules and Extensions. Your libraries and applications can also use
  this framework to be very easily extensible.


Weak points
===========

- Tiny tool. This will improve over time.

- Because of no tool like 'moc' is used, there is no meta object information for-free.
