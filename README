What is the Ideal Library ?
===========================

The Ideal Library is a free, intuitive, easy-to-use and consistent library meant to easily develop
powerful applications and libraries.


Strong points
=============

- Signal/slot mechanism.

      Over Qt and Gtk:
      Connections, as well as their correctness is checked in compile time. In Qt or Gtk you can
      mispell a signal name that will compile just fine, but will not work.

      Over Qt and Gtk:
      Signals respect the ambit in which they are defined. In Qt or Gtk signals haven't got
      an ambit assigned.

      Over Qt and Gtk:
      When writing code or refactoring, you do not need to check the whole sources for fixing
      connections.

      Over Qt:
      All methods are slots. You can connect a signal to any method, static function or another
      signal.

      Over Qt:
      No need of other tool than the compiler for compiling your library or application. For
      instance, in Qt based code, you need to run `moc` in order to compile your code.

- Extensible.

      Due to a system of Modules and Extensions, the Ideal Library as well as the libraries and
      applications are very easily extensible.

      This system does not require special files like *.desktop files or such.

- TDD.

      We try to write rock solid software by following a heavy Test Driven Development.


Weak points
===========

- Not as big/complete as Qt or Gtk.

- Needs a C++0x compliant compiler.

      GCC 4.4.0 can do it.

- Not multiplatform yet.

      It is being developed with this feature in mind. Right now, the only written/being written
      backend is the POSIX one.


Philosophy
==========

- Do not reinvent the wheel.

      If a library can do its job successfully, use it and depend on it. We will benefit for free
      from its improvements and fixes.

      This rule has a notable exception: we cannot depend on libraries which depend on others fairly
      bigger, like, say, GLib. If this is the case, we have a reason for reinventing the wheel.

- KISS.

- KICS.

     "Keep It Correct, Stupid". Due to a hard test driven development, we try to write rock solid
     software.

- Focus on today. Focus on future.

     Do not lose your time trying to get the Ideal Library compile with GCC 0.1-rc5. You can get
     for free (as in free beer) a system that can build and run this software.

     Focus on improving the code instead.
